# Engl.105-Unit.3
This is a repository contiang instrucitonal materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The repository contains three python notebooks, covering basic topics in coding with Python3, and modules explaining how to use the Pandas package for data analysis. There is also a fourth python notebook which outlines, step by step, how to create your own subset of data from a much larger data base.

The first three notebooks have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library. The fourth notebook was created by me for an assignment.
